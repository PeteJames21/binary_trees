# Binary Trees
A C-implementation of a binary tree data structure.

## 0-binary_tree_node.c
Write a function that creates a binary tree node.

## 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c
Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node. If the parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

## 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c
Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node. If the parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.

## 3-binary_tree_delete.c
Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree.

## 4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c
Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf.

## 5-binary_tree_is_root.c
Write a function that checks if a given node is a root.

## 6-binary_tree_preorder.c
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.

## 7-binary_tree_inorder.c
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal.

## 8-binary_tree_postorder.c
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal.

## 9-binary_tree_height.c
Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree.

## 10-binary_tree_depth.c
Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.

## 11-binary_tree_size.c
Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree.
